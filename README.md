# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

### Overview
The goal of this project is to merege, lable and extract multiple data sets in order to prepare tidy data set that can be used for further analysis. 

We have used Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set proveded by UCI Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems. The dataset and its description can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
 

## Project Description

In this project we have created an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following setps.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How To Run The Program

This program is designed to require minimum configuration.
